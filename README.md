## Assumptions

If the difference in time is <=0 then this is an error.
Correct distances are positive and backwards travel is considered positive.

## Brainstorming

I knew right from the start that I would need to create a new object that had the average speed and total distance stored. I decided to store this in a dictionary for easy access and search when looking up a particular driver.

## File Structure

main: This file contains code that opens the file, parses, cleans and prints out the given data.

create_driver: this file contains code that creates and updates drivers in the system.

test_cases: folder that stores test cases for the program. Edge cases test cases are denoted with the prefix "edge_case".

Expected_output: folder that contains expected output for the test cases
